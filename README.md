# 🕹️ Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a basic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It is a two-player game where **Player 1 uses X** and **Player 2 uses O**. I developed this project during my final year of B.Tech to improve my frontend development skills and better understand how JavaScript handles DOM manipulation and game logic.

2. Players take turns by clicking on the grid.
3. If a player gets 3 in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), they win.
4. If all 9 squares are filled with no winner, the game ends in a tie.
